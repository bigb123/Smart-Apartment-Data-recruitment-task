/*
 * This function is checking access to external and internal sites. However,
 * internal EC2 instance that is running Åƒginx in private subnet has non-static
 * ip address. in real life scenario I should avoid hardcoding. To achieve it
 * I will have to:
 * 1 - read the ip address from the EC2 instance during this code runtime, or
 * 2 - set up the internal load balancer
 * 
 * As none of these is a part of the task specification I decided to 
 * follow the easiest way by hardcoding ip address of the instance 
 * into the Lambda function that proves the VPC is configured properly
 * and the Lambda function can access web pages placed externally and 
 * internally.
